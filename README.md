## Quick Start

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   bun install
   ```

2. **Start Development Server:**
   ```bash
   bun dev
   ```
   Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

3. **Build for Production (Static Export):**
   ```bash
   bun run build
   ```
   The static site will be generated in the `out/` directory with optimized images.

4. **Development Build (faster, no image optimization):**
   ```bash
   bun run build:dev
   ```

## CLI Commands

```bash
# Development
bun dev                    # Start dev server at localhost:3000
bun run lint               # Run ESLint

# Build
bun run build              # Full production build (copy assets + Next.js build + image optimization)
bun run build:dev          # Development build (no image optimization, faster)
bun run clean              # Remove .next, out, public/posts directories

# Testing
bun test                   # Run all tests
bun run test:unit          # Run unit tests (src/)
bun run test:int           # Run integration tests
bun run test:e2e           # Run end-to-end tests

# Content creation
bun run new "Post Title"                          # Create new post (flat file)
bun run new "Title" --folder                      # Create as folder with index.mdx
bun run new "Title" --prefix weekly               # Create with prefix (e.g., weekly-title)
bun run new "Title" --template custom             # Use custom template from templates/
bun run new "Title" --md                          # Create as .md instead of .mdx
bun run new "Title" --series my-series            # Create post in a series directory
bun run new-series "Series Name"                  # Create new series with cover image placeholder
bun run new-from-pdf doc.pdf                      # Create post from PDF (converts pages to images)
bun run new-from-pdf doc.pdf --title "My Doc"     # With custom title
bun run new-from-pdf doc.pdf --scale 3.0          # Higher resolution (default: 2.0)
bun run new-from-images ./photos                  # Create post from image folder
bun run new-from-images ./photos --title "Gallery" # With custom title
bun run new-from-images ./photos --sort date      # Sort by date (default: name)
bun run new-from-images ./photos --no-copy        # Reference images instead of copying
bun run new-note "Concept"                        # Create a new atomic note
bun run new-flow-from-chat                        # Import all new files in imports/chats/
bun run sync-book                                 # Sync book chapters with files on disk
bun run series-draft "series-slug"                # Set all posts in a series to draft
bun run series-draft "series-slug" --undraft      # Remove draft status from series posts
```

### Importing Chat Logs to Flows

Amytis includes a powerful script to convert chat logs (like those from LLMs or messaging apps) into Flow entries.

1. Place your `.txt` or `.log` files in `imports/chats/`.
2. Ensure the format is:
   ```
   Author Name YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss
   Message content line 1
   Message content line 2
   ```
3. Run the importer:
   ```bash
   bun run new-flow-from-chat
   ```

Options:
- `--all`: Re-import every file (ignores history).
- `--dry-run`: Preview changes without writing files.
- `--author "Name"`: Only include messages from a specific author.
- `--append`: Append to existing flow files instead of skipping.
- `--timestamp`: Include timestamps in the rendered blocks.

Import history is tracked in `imports/chats/.imported`.

## Configuration

All site settings are managed in `site.config.ts`:

```typescript
export const siteConfig = {
  // ...
  nav: [
    { name: "Home", url: "/", weight: 1 },
    { name: "Flow", url: "/flows", weight: 1.1 }, // Add Flows to nav
    { name: "Series", url: "/series", weight: 1.5 },
    { name: "Books", url: "/books", weight: 1.7 },
    { name: "Archive", url: "/archive", weight: 2 },
    // ...
  ],
  // ...
  flows: {
    recentCount: 5,
  },
};
```

## Writing Content

### Posts

Create `.md` or `.mdx` files in `content/posts/`.

### Flows

Create daily notes in `content/flows/YYYY/MM/DD.mdx` or `content/flows/YYYY/MM/DD/index.mdx`.

### Series

Create a directory in `content/series/` with an `index.mdx`.

### Books

Books are for long-form, structured content. Create a directory in `content/books/`.

### Notes

Create evergreen notes in `content/notes/` (e.g., `concept.mdx`). Use `[[wiki-links]]` to connect them.
