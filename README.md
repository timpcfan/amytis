# Amytis

**Amytis** is an elegant, open-source framework for building a personal digital garden: a living knowledge space where ideas grow from raw notes to refined writing. It is built with Next.js 16, React 19, and Tailwind CSS v4, with a strong focus on readability, structure, and long-term content ownership.

## The Knowledge Ladder

Amytis is built around a simple path from rough to refined:

- **Flow**: Capture raw daily thoughts and fragments.
- **Articles**: Refine one idea into a clear essay.
- **Series**: Connect related articles into a curated narrative.
- **Books**: Distill mature knowledge into structured chapters and parts.

Each stage builds on the previous one, so your garden can evolve naturally.

## Features

- **Digital Garden Philosophy:** Non-linear navigation through tags, series, authors, books, flows, and chronological archives.
- **Interconnected Knowledge:**
  - **Wiki-links:** Bidirectional linking (`[[Slug]]`) between all content types.
  - **Backlinks:** Automatic "Linked References" display on notes.
  - **Knowledge Graph:** Interactive visual map of your content connections.
- **Full-text Search:** Fast, static client-side search across all content (Cmd/Ctrl+K) powered by Pagefind.
- **Structured Content:**
  - **Series:** Multi-part content organization with manual or automatic ordering.
  - **Books:** Long-form content with explicit chapters, parts, and a dedicated reading interface.
  - **Notes:** Atomic, evergreen concepts for personal knowledge management.
  - **Flows:** Stream-style daily notes or micro-blogging for quick thoughts.
- **Rich MDX Content:**
  - GitHub Flavored Markdown (tables, task lists, strikethrough).
  - Syntax-highlighted code blocks.
  - Mermaid diagrams (flowcharts, sequence diagrams, etc.).
  - LaTeX math via KaTeX.
  - Raw HTML support for custom layouts.
- **Elegant Design:**
  - Minimalist aesthetic with high-contrast typography.
  - Light/Dark mode with automatic system detection.
  - Four color palettes: default (emerald), blue, rose, amber.
  - Responsive layout optimized for reading.
  - Horizontal scrolling for featured content on the homepage.
- **Table of Contents:** Sticky TOC with scroll tracking, reading progress indicator, and active heading highlight.
- **Flexible Content Structure:**
  - Flat files (`post.mdx`) or nested folders (`post/index.mdx`).
  - Co-located assets: keep images inside post folders (`./images/`).
  - Date-prefixed filenames: `2026-01-01-my-post.mdx`.
  - Draft support for posts, series, books, and flows.
- **Performance & SEO:**
  - Fully static export with optimized WebP images.
  - Native sitemap and RSS feed generation.
  - Multilingual reading time estimate (supports Latin and CJK).
- **Integrations:**
  - Analytics: Umami, Plausible, or Google Analytics.
  - Comments: Giscus (GitHub Discussions) or Disqus.
  - Internationalization: multi-language support (en, zh) with localized `site.config.ts`.
- **Content CLI Tools:** Create posts, series, and import from PDFs or image folders.
- **Modern Stack:** Next.js 16, React 19, Tailwind CSS v4, TypeScript 5, Bun.

## Design Philosophy

- **Elegance by default**: Typography, spacing, and color should feel intentional out of the box.
- **Content over configuration**: Writing and publishing should be simple file-based workflows, not CMS-heavy setup.
- **Markdown-first, not markdown-limited**: Keep authoring portable while supporting rich output (math, diagrams, code, wikilinks).
- **Ship what you need**: Features are modular through `site.config.ts`; disable sections you do not use.
- **Plain text, long-term ownership**: Content stays in Markdown/MDX so it remains versionable and portable.

## Quick Start

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   bun install
   ```

2. **Start Development Server:**
   ```bash
   bun dev
   ```
   Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

3. **Build for Production (Static Export):**
   ```bash
   bun run build
   ```
   The static site will be generated in the `out/` directory with optimized images.

4. **Development Build (faster, no image optimization):**
   ```bash
   bun run build:dev
   ```

## CLI Commands

```bash
## Core
bun dev
bun run lint
bun run validate

## Build
bun run build
bun run build:dev
bun run clean

## Test
bun test
bun run test:unit
bun run test:int
bun run test:e2e

## Create Content
bun run new "Post Title"
bun run new-series "Series Name"
bun run new-note "Concept"
bun run new-flow

## Import / Maintain
bun run new-from-pdf ./doc.pdf
bun run new-from-images ./photos
bun run new-flow-from-chat
bun run import-book
bun run sync-book
bun run series-draft "series-slug"
```

### Importing Chat Logs to Flows

Drop `.txt` or `.log` files into `imports/chats/`, then run:

```bash
bun run new-flow-from-chat
```

Common flags: `--all`, `--dry-run`, `--author "Name"`, `--append`, `--timestamp`.
Import history is stored in `imports/chats/.imported`.

## Configuration

All site settings are managed in `site.config.ts`:

```typescript
export const siteConfig = {
  // ...
  nav: [
    { name: "Home", url: "/", weight: 1 },
    { name: "Flow", url: "/flows", weight: 1.1 }, // Add Flows to nav
    { name: "Series", url: "/series", weight: 1.5 },
    { name: "Books", url: "/books", weight: 1.7 },
    { name: "Archive", url: "/archive", weight: 2 },
    // ...
  ],
  // ...
  flows: {
    recentCount: 5,
  },
};
```

## Writing Content

### Posts

Create `.md` or `.mdx` files in `content/posts/`.

### Flows

Create daily notes in `content/flows/YYYY/MM/DD.mdx` or `content/flows/YYYY/MM/DD/index.mdx`.

### Series

Create a directory in `content/series/` with an `index.mdx`.

### Books

Books are for long-form, structured content. Create a directory in `content/books/`.

### Notes

Create evergreen notes in `content/notes/` (e.g., `concept.mdx`). Use `[[wiki-links]]` to connect them.
